1. Prepare the release artifacts.

2. Upload the release artifacts to the SVN repository.

3. Verify the release artifacts.

4. Initiate a release vote.

5. Announce the results and the release.


### Prepare the release artifacts.

1. Create a branch from the target git repository.

2. Tag a RC and draft the release notes.

3. Build and Sign the release artifacts (including source archives, binaries, ...etc).

4. Generate checksums for the artifacts.


#### How to Sign the release artifacts.

1. Create a GPG key

2. Add the GPG key to the KEYS file

3. Sign the release artifacts with the GPG key.

```bash
# create a GPG key, after executing this command, select the first one RSA å’Œ RSA
$ gpg --full-generate-key

# list the GPG keys
$ gpg  --keyid-format SHORT --list-keys

# upload the GPG key to the key server, xxx is the GPG key id
# eg: pub rsa4096/4C21E346 2024-05-06 [SC], 4C21E346 is the GPG key id;
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-key xxx

# append the GPG key to the KEYS file the svn repository
# [IMPORTANT] Don't replace the KEYS file, just append the GPG key to the KEYS file. 
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/answer/
$ (gpg --list-sigs xxx@apache.org && gpg --export --armor xxx@apache.org) >> KEYS 
$ svn ci -m "add gpg key" 

# sign the release artifacts, xxxx is xxx@apache.org
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg --local-user xxxx --armor --output $i.asc --detach-sig $i ; done
```


#### How to Generate checksums for the release artifacts.

```bash
# create the checksums
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; sha512sum  $i > $i.sha512 ; done
```


### Upload the release artifacts to the SVN repository.

`https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/gluten/`

`https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/gluten/{release-version}`
release-version format: apache-gluten-#.#.#-rc#

3. Upload the release artifacts to the SVN repository.
```bash
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/gluten/
$ cp /path/to/release/artifacts/* ./{release-version}/
$ svn add ./{release-version}/*
$ svn commit -m "add Apache Answer release artifacts for {release-version}"
```

4. After the upload, please visit the link `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/gluten/{release-version}` to verify if the file upload is successful or not.
The upload release artifacts should be include
```bash
* apache-gluten-#.#.#-incubating-src.tar.gz
* apache-gluten-#.#.#-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc
* apache-gluten-#.#.#-incubating-src.tar.gz.sha512
```


### Verify the release artifacts.

Please follow below steps to verify the release artifacts.

1. Check if the Download links are valid.

$ curl https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/gluten/KEYS > KEYS

# import KEYS and trust the key, please replace the email address with the one you want to trust.
$ gpg --import KEYS
$ gpg --edit-key xxx@apache.org
gpg> trust
gpg> 5
gpg> y
gpg> quit

# enter the directory where the release artifacts are located
$ cd /path/to/release/artifacts

# verify the signature
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg --verify $i.asc $i ; done

# if you see 'Good signature' in the output, it means the signature is valid.
```


#### How to Verify the checksums

Please follow below steps to verify the checksums
```bash
# verify the checksums
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; sha512sum --check  $i.sha512; done
```
